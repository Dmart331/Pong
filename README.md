## Pong Clone
This was created as a code challenge. 

## Requirements
Unity 5

## Controlls
- Player Left:
  - UP - W
  - Down - S
  - Freeze Ball - Tab
             
- Player Right: 
  - Up Arrow
  - Down Arrow
  - Freeze Ball: Return

## Lessons Learned
- Changing parent on an object is a lot more simple then I made it out to be. I struggled with making the ball move with the player until I realized that you can just set the parent to the object that is already moving. 

- Making the physics on the ball freeze was a struggle. I was over complicating this by making it continue on its path after unfrozen. This was the wrong way to go about it. I really just wanted the ball to stop and be shot the other way after being caught. 

- Always have fun with the project.. A few times I got frustrated, but quickly realized that I was doing something that I have never done before. Every time I got frustrated, I reminded myself that I was learning something new with every step. There is nothing better than getting the feeling of making something work that wasn't previously.
